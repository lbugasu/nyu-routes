# NYU_Shuttle
This is my development of the Android version of NYU Shuttle

Being a student in the city of New York can be hectic. 
Expecially being a student whose campus is NYC can be frustrating, with trying to catch the bus, trying to get coffee before catching the bus, trying to plan when to do groceries so that you get home in time. 

NYU Shuttle is the go to app for all your bus needs. 

#The iOS version of the app was developed. And here is the Android. With a few more features and personalization added.
